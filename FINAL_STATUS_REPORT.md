## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Form Fields** ✅ FIXED

- **Solution**: Updated `app.py` to capture all form fields
- **Result**: All form data now properly saved to database

### 2. **Database Schema Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Database schema didn't match the actual form fields
- **Solution**: Updated `models.py` schema and validation functions
- **Result**: Proper validation and data storage

### 3. **Enhanced Validation** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Added**: Better email validation for both student and parent
- **Added**: Improved phone number validation (handles formatted numbers)
- **Added**: Education level validation
- **Added**: Future date validation for demo bookings
- **Result**: More robust form validation

### 4. **CSRF Protection** ✅ SECURED

## 🔍 What Was Actually Happening

The **"loading"** issue you experienced was likely due to:

1. **Form validation errors** - Missing required fields or validation failures
2. **CSRF token issues** - Forms were protected but tokens weren't properly included
3. **JavaScript validation** - Client-side validation preventing submission

**The database connection was actually working** - the issue was in the form processing pipeline.
