python database_check.py

# Test enrollment form functionality
python -c "from models import validate_enrollment, create_enrollment; print('Enrollment system working')"

# View current enrollments
python -c "from pymongo import MongoClient; client = MongoClient('mongodb+srv://dotpyacademy1:m57HHUwKiNwggGB0@dotpy.bpeap9q.mongodb.net/dotpy_academy?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=dotpy'); print(f'Enrollments: {client.dotpy_academy.enrollments.count_documents({})}'); print(f'Demo bookings: {client.dotpy_academy.demo_bookings.count_documents({})}')"
```

## 📝 Form Processing Flow

### Enrollment Form Flow:
1. **User submits form** → `/enroll` route
2. **Data extraction** → All form fields captured
3. **Validation** → `validate_enrollment()` function
4. **Database insertion** → `create_enrollment()` function
5. **User feedback** → Success/error message displayed

### Demo Booking Form Flow:
1. **User submits form** → `/book-demo` route
2. **Data extraction** → All demo form fields captured
3. **Validation** → Built-in validation in route
4. **Database insertion** → Direct MongoDB insertion
5. **User feedback** → Success/error message displayed
